# GNRTV.CELLS (Generative Cells)
-_-
is a 'Toolkit' inspired by the modular synthesizers (which have been so successful in the last decade) 
in the framework of the algorithmic music, to be able to build Generative* (Algorythmic) instruments 
(i.e. which can be partially or fully automated inspired by physical and biological models).
GNRTV.CELLS Toolkit has applications for :
live performance music, New·Media Art projects, Interactive, Immersive installations, Sonic Engines, etc.



* Generative, therefore based on physical models and/or biological models. 
It is worth to remind that although it has some conceptual common concepts with AI, 
generative methods are inspired by other kind of intelligences 
and emergency systems with a non anthropocentric perspective.
